Graph API offers a ton of monitoring reports that give system admins insights into their Office 365 tenant. Please find the official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/report?view=graph-rest-1.0). In today's article, we will take a look at a report that lists the aggregated Outlook activity per day, for an entire organisation. [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getemailactivityusercounts?view=graph-rest-1.0)'s the relevant documentation.

Please make sure to read through the basics of using MS Graph API in Peakboard: [MS Graph API - Understand the basis and get started]({% post_url 2023-06-09-MS-Graph-API-Understand-the-basis-and-get-started %})

## Configuring the data source

The correct URL for the report is:

{% highlight url %}
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/reports/microsoft.graph.getEmailActivityCounts(period='D30')
{% endhighlight %}

We provide an additional parameter, `period='D30'`, to indicate that we only want the data from the last 30 days. For the data source, we use a _App-only_ Graph extension list that doesn't require any user delegation. Depending on how you configured your AD-registered app, please make sure to have granted the permission for `Reports.Read.All` there.

## Getting the data ready

All the data comes as string data types, so it's hard to to use it in a chart later. We need to add a data flow below the data source, to adjust the columns for later use.

We convert the two columns `Send` and `Receive` into numbers.

And we remove all the useless columns, except for the data and the two numbers we're interested in. That's it.

## Building the chart

A line and area chart is a good choice to display the data. In this case, we use two series. One for the received emails, and one for the sent emails. The x-axis is always the date. The configuration is straightforward, as we already prepared the data very well.

Let's go ahead and have a look at the final result:
