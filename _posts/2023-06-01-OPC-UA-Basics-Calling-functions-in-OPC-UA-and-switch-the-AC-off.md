 In this [article]({% post_url 2023-05-15-OPC-UA-Basics-Getting-started-with-a-public-OPC-UA-server %}) we learned how to subscribe to OPC-UA-nodes and process the incoming values. The sample was around an A/C that provided several values like the temperature. Tody we will learn how to switch the A/C on and off by using so called OPC-UA-functions.

 At this point we strongly recommand downloading another very useful tool called [UA Expert](https://www.unified-automation.com/products/development-tools/uaexpert.html). It's free of charge and the perfect tool to play around with any kind of OPC UA server. We will also use it in this tutorial.
