This article combines several technologies and how to handle them. Here's the goal: Every time a ticket is created in Zendesk, it is supposed to be sent to a Peakboard announcement board informing the viewer about the the new ticket. And here's how we do it with the help of [n8n.io](http://8n8.io):

1. The n8n workflow is listening to the zendesk inbox and fires every time a ticket arrives.
2. With the ticket number from the trigger additional information is queried from Zendesk
3. The Zendesk ticket as a whole is sent to a MQTT broker
4. Peakboard is subscribed to the MQTT node and processes the complex Zendesk JSon and picks out the information needed

If you want to re-build this tutorial feel free to use a trial of n8n.io. Beside the n8n.io-account you will need administrator access to your Zendesk account. Check the settings there and get an API key. You will need this API key to access the Zendesk data from n8n.io.
Here's the workflow we build in n8n.io. The initial trigger is the creation of a Zendesk ticket, then additional information is queried from Zendesk, then the ticket is sent to MQTT:

### Building the workflow in n8n.io

The screenshot shows, how the trigger is to be configured. You need to provide the API key and connect n8n.io to Zendesk. Then you have to define the trigger. In our case we just let the trigger fire every time the status of ticket changes. If you want to use this in real world, just adjust it to your needs. As you see, the trigger only pumps out the ticket number. Nothing else.

In the next step we use a second Zendesk related function to get the details of the ticket. The screenshot shows in clear way, that the JSon with the ticket number is the input. The ticket number is sent to Zendesk. And the return is a complex JSon that contains all the information we need about the ticket (e.g. subject, sender, etc...).

The next and last workflow item is to send the whole JSon without any modification to a MQTT broker. In our case we use a public broker test.mosquitto.org. So no hustle with authentification.

### Building the board and process the MQTT message

On the Peakboard side we just use a regular MQTT source to catch the nodes from the broker. As you see in the screenshot, we use data paths to pick out the information from the complex JSon that we want. In our case it's the sender, subject and description. The sender's name is even a bit more complicated path as you have to go down several hierachy layers within the JSon.

Here's the easy part. On the canvas we place a tile to display Sender, Subject and Description by directly linking to the data source.

### Live Test

Before we test the whole process, please make sure, that the n8n.io workflow is running, either as "active" or in debug-mode. And also switch on the board at least in preview mode. Then we can send an email to the Zendesk account and see, how the ticket finds its way automatically to the board. Beautiful!

PS: As you see in the last screenshot the line breaks are not handled well. We will discuss this in another article :-)
