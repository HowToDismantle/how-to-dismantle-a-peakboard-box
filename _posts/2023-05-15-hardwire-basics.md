You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  int i, n;
  bool is_prime = true;

  cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
  cin >> n;

  // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
    is_prime = false;
  }

  // loop to check if n is prime
  for (i = 2; i <= n/2; ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      is_prime = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (is_prime)
    cout << n << " is a prime number";
  else
    cout << n << " is not a prime number";
{% endhighlight %}
